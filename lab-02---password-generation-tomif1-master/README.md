### Assignment Description
This week, we will be creating and running a Python script file that generates a password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. We will do this using concepts including if statements, loops, and functions.
### Lab Steps
You will perform the following steps to complete the Week 1 lab:
1. Fetch the repository for the assignment and update your Name and S-Number in the Readme.md file
2. Review the generatePassword.py file and read the comments. Take note of the areas where I ask you to write or modify the code.
3. Watch the lab video (optional) if you would like some suggestions on how to go about this lab
4. Grab a Mountain Dew and write some code!
5. Test your code. Go back to Step 4 if something doesn't work.
6. Commit, push, and take a break!
### Lab Requirements
1. Python script successfully generates a random password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols as chosen by the user (the user has the option to use any or all of these to generate the password)
2. To generate the password, the script asks the user for password length and whether or not to use each of the characters as defined in requirement 1.
3. The users responses are passed as arguments to a function generatePassword, a function that has parameters for each of those user responses.
4. That function uses if statement(s) and loop(s) to generate a new random password. Please see the code file for a hint on using Python's random class.
5. That function returns the newly generated password as a return value
6. The new password is displayed to the user
### Lab Rubric
The lab will be graded using the following rubric. Total 10 points for the assignment.

| Submission Expectations (max 1pt) | Project was not committed to GitHub  (0-0.5pt) | Project was partially committed to GitHub (0.5-1pt) | Project was fully committed to GitHub (1pt) |
| Functional Expectations (max 9pt) | The code does not function nor does it follow all instructions. There are significant errors and the program cannot be run. Student did not adhere to the assignment. (0-6pt) | Most instructions were followed and there may or may not be an error that prevents the application from running. Student generally adhered the assignment. (6-9pt) | Instructions were followed. Code was well commented and understandable. There are no errors and the application runs as expected. (9pt) |
