### Assignment Description
For Part 2 of your final project, you will be coding a Python script that covers the requirements you wrote in Part 1. 

### Lab Steps
Overall Requirements:
•	Code is due by the date indicated in Blackboard into GitHub. LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND WILL RESULT IN A ZERO GRADE.
•	Only one person per group required to submit.
•	Must implement TWO of the three features below (your choice)
•	You must create a text-based user interface (menu) where the user use one of the features or exit the application
•	Once a feature is used by the user, the user is taken back to the main menu
•	Each of the features you choose must be implemented as one or more functions
Features (Choose TWO)
•	Encrypt and decrypt user input (Substitution Cipher)
o	Take an input from a user with a minimum string length of 1 and a maximum string length of 20 characters
	If the user does not supply input meeting this criteria, warn the user and ask for input again
o	Display the original plaintext
o	Encrypt the string
o	Display the cyphertext
o	Decrypt the string
o	Display the decrypted text
o	Go back to the main menu
•	Generate a password for a user (Password Generation)
o	Ask the user whether they want one or more of the following items:
	Uppercase Letters
	Lowercase Letters
	Numbers
	Symbols
o	If the user selects NONE of the above items, warn the user and ask again
o	Ask the user how long they want the password to be, with a minimum of three characters in length and a maximum of 18 characters in length
	If the user does not supply a length value meeting this criteria, warn the user and ask for the length again
o	Generate the password and display to the user
o	Go back to the main menu
•	Find and display phone numbers on a webpage (OSINT)
o	Ask the user for a URL
	If the user does not supply a URL, warn the user and ask for the URL again
o	Download the webpage
o	Run pattern matching on the webpage for phone numbers
o	Display all the phone numbers found on the webpage
o	Go back to the main menu

### Lab Rubric
Rubric for Part 2:
1. Submission Expectations (max 2pt)
    * 1.5-5: Project was fully committed to GitHub 
    * 0-1.5: Project was partially committed to GitHub 
	* 0: Project was not committed to GitHub 
2. Solution implementation (max 7 pts)
    * 6-10: A full solution is implemented that implements all features in the software requirements document. 
    * 3-6: A completed solution is implemented and it meets most of the specifications outlined in the specifications document. It may run with some errors. 
    * 0-3: An incomplete solution is implemented on the required platform. It does not compile and/or run. 
3. User interface (max 7 pts)
    * 6-10: User interface is natural to the user and runs without error. 
    * 3-6: User interface generally meets the specifications and is acceptable. 
    * 0-3: User interface is incomplete, and the application is unusable. 
4. Code Readability (max 7 points)
    * 6-10: All required comments are present, program is correctly indented, appropriate variable names are used. 
    * 3-6: Program is minimally commented, some variable names are appropriate, inconsistent indentation. 
    * 0-3: Insufficient commenting, incorrect indentation, poor variable selection. 
5. Program Design (max 7 points)
    * 6-10: The overall program design is well thought out and appropriate. 
    * 3-6: The program design generally uses appropriate structures. Program elements exhibit good design
    * 0-3: Few of the structures (conditionals, functions, etc.) are appropriate. Program elements are not well designed.
