# IT 2750 - Lab 04
___
#### Your Name: Oluwatomisin Fayomi
#### S-Number: S01248177
___
### Assignment Description
In this lab, we will be creating and running a Python script that accepts input, encrypts that input, and decrypts that input. Your job is to write the lines of code that decrypt ciphetext given a key using a substitution cipher.
### Lab Steps
You will perform the following steps to complete the lab:
1. Fetch the repository for the assignment and update your Name and S-Number in the Readme.md file
2. Review the subCipher.py file and read the comments. Take note of the area where I ask you to write or modify the code.
3. Watch the lab video (optional) if you would like some suggestions on how to go about this lab
4. Grab a Mountain Dew and write some code!
5. Test your code. Try a bunch of different strings. Make sure that the decrypted text is exactly the same as the input text
6. Commit, push, and take a break!
### Lab Requirements
1. Review the code in subCipher.py and study how the script operates. Apply the concepts you learned this week to understand how the encryption function works
2. Fill in code in the decryption function that "reverses" the encryption done in the encrypt function using the concepts of a substitution cipher
### Lab Rubric
The lab will be graded using the following rubric. Total 10 points for the assignment.

| Rubric Item | Novice | Competent | Proficient |

| Functional Expectations (max 9pt) | The code does not function nor does it follow all instructions. There are significant errors and the program cannot be run. Student did not adhere to the assignment. (0-6pt) | Most instructions were followed and there may or may not be an error that prevents the application from running. Student generally adhered the assignment. (6-9pt) | Instructions were followed. Code was well commented and understandable. There are no errors and the application runs as expected. (9pt) |
