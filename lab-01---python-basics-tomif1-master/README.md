### Assignment Description
Welcome to the class! In this lab, we will be creating and running a simple Python script file and pushing your changes to Git. The actual assignment will be pretty light this week as I want to make sure everyone understands the process going forward for the remaining weeks
### Lab Steps
You will perform the following steps to complete the Week 1 lab:
1. Install Python, Git, Visual Studio Code, and Git Desktop. You aren't required to use any of those tools except python, however for those unfamiliar this is a pretty simple toolset and I will be using them in my example videos.
2. Sign up for GitHub if you haven't already and use your account to accept the assignment in GitHub classroom.
3. Fetch the repository for the assignment and write some code!
    * Fetch the assignment repository (I have filled out a template for you this week to help guide you in your journey)
	* Open up this readme.md file and add your name and S#
	* Open hello.py in your favorite text editor
    * Follow the instructions in each comment
	* Commit and push your code back to GitHub
